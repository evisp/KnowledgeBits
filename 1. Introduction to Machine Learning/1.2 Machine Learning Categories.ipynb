    "## üîë Key Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) enables computers to **learn from data and make predictions** or decisions. The  goal of ML is to develop algorithms that allow computers to **improve their performance on a specific task through experience**, without being explicitly programmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main branches of machine learning, each with its unique focus and applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore these categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/4_ml_categories.png\" alt=\"Logo\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\">\n",

    "### Supervised Learning: Guided Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Supervised learning is like learning with the help of a teacher. It involves learning from examples where each example comes with a clear answer. This way, the system can learn to make predictions or decisions by discovering general rules, or patterns in the examples it's given.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**: In supervised learning, we work with a dataset where each example consists of input data, often referred to as **features**, and their corresponding correct outputs, known as **labels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is for the algorithm to learn the underlying patterns or relationships between the input features and the labels.  It uses this knowledge to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data based on what it has learned from the labeled examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, supervised learning teaches the algorithm to generalize its understanding of the data, allowing it to perform tasks like image recognition, language translation, or predicting future values with a high degree of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Think of unsupervised learning as a scenario where you don't have a teacher guiding you but instead explore a new city on your own. In this case, you're given a map of the city (your dataset), but there are no labels or instructions. Your task is to identify interesting patterns or groupings in the city's layout, such as neighborhoods, landmarks, or common routes people take.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start by wandering around, observing the streets and buildings (data points), and noticing similarities or connections between them. Over time, you might recognize that certain areas have similar types of architecture or that people tend to gather in specific places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**: An unsupervised learning algorithm doesn't rely on labeled examples to guide the learning process. Instead, it explores datasets on its own, seeking to find patterns, structures, or hidden relationships within the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a collection of data points, like customer profiles or text documents. The algorithm starts by examining the features of these data points, which are characteristics that describe them, such as age, income, or word frequency. It then analyzes these features to identify similarities, differences, or connections between the data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common task is clustering, where similar data points are grouped together into clusters or categories. Another task is dimensionality reduction, where the algorithm simplifies the data by selecting the most important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Doing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Have you ever tried to teach a child how to do something? A good strategy of guiding a child's behavior is through rewards and consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, much like how a child learns from their surroundings. Just as we encourage a child with treats when s/he performs a desired action or correct a child when they misbehave, reinforcement learning relies on a similar concept of rewards and penalties. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes actions within an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. Over time, it learns to make better decisions by maximizing its cumulative reward. This trial-and-error approach helps it discover the most optimal strategies for achieving specific goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**: Reinforcement learning revolves around an **agent** (such as a robot, game-playing AI, or autonomous car) that interacts with its **environment**, navigating through various situations represented in a **state space**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent learns how to make decisions by following a **policy**, a strategy that helps it choose actions based on its current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to accumulate **rewards** while avoiding \"penalties\" within the environment. The agent continually adjusts its policy to maximize long-term rewards. This paradigm enables autonomous learning and adaptation in complex scenarios where explicit instructions are not possible or practical\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning impacts many fields. It helps us predict outcomes, like stock price prediction, weather conditions, movie recommendations, detecting spam emails or diagnosing medical conditions. It groups similar items, like sorting documents or spotting unusual activities in cybersecurity. It also guides decision-making, like teaching robots to navigate or optimizing ads online. In various ways, machine learning makes tasks smarter and quicker across different areas, making our lives more convenient and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/supervised.png\" alt=\"Logo\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid Annoying Spams**: Supervised learning in spam detection is applied to develop a model that can differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. The model learns from a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is marked as spam or not. By training on these examples, the model aims to accurately categorize new, incoming emails as either spam or not, effectively filtering out unwanted messages from users' email inboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Classification**: Supervised learning is widely used in image classification tasks, such as recognizing objects in photos. By training a model with labeled images, it can learn to identify objects, animals, or even people. This technology is the backbone of facial recognition systems, self-driving cars' object detection, and countless other applications that rely on image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Supervised learning helps in tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbot responses. By training models with large datasets containing text and their corresponding labels or translations, the algorithms can understand and generate human-like text. This is the foundation for virtual assistants like Siri or AI-driven language translation services like Google Translate.\n",

    "### Applications of Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/unsupervised.png\" alt=\"Logo\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering and Customer Segmentation**: Unsupervised learning helps businesses group customers or data points with similar characteristics without predefined labels. For example, in marketing, it can segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, allowing companies to tailor marketing strategies to specific customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Unsupervised learning is essential in identifying unusual patterns or anomalies within data. In cybersecurity, it can detect unusual network activity or potential security breaches by learning the normal behavior of a network and flagging deviations from that norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Unsupervised learning techniques are used to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data while retaining its essential features. This is crucial in various fields, such as genetics, where it helps researchers analyze and visualize complex genetic data by reducing it to its most informative components.\n",

    "An easy way to experiment with machine learning is to use [Teachable Machine] to train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, and poses. The goal is to create a custom machine learning model that can classify objects or actions based on input from your device's camera or microphone. This involves training the model by providing examples of the objects or actions you want it to recognize. \n",
    "\n",
    "The  main steps to achieve this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gathering and labeling data**: Collect a set of images or audio recordings representing the different classes or categories you want your model to identify. Label each example to indicate which class it belongs to. Gather for example several objects at your surroundings, such as books, mugs, or vairous types of fruits. Use the camera to record multiple screenshots of these objects, all at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training the model**: Upload your labeled data to Teachable Machine and use it to train your custom model. The platform will automatically generate a machine learning model based on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and using the model**: Once your model is trained, you can test it in real-time using your device's camera or microphone. It will classify objects or actions based on what it has learned from your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, you can experiment with supervised learning classification using Teachable Machine to create models tailored to your specific needs and applications."
