    "# Knowledge Bits: Intro to Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of machine learning is the idea of empowering computers **to learn and improve from *experience*, without being explicitly programmed**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/1_ml.png\" alt=\"Learn Without Being Explicitly Programmed\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if computer systems could learn from trial and error, as humans do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of machine learning is to give a computer the ability to learn from raw data and recognize patterns that *explain* those data. As it gets more data, it adjusts itself and improves its performance by learning how to make smart choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **successful machine learning system** requires two key ingredients: **good data**, and **good algorithms**. Failure in each, could seriously impact the capabilities of machine learning\n",

    "#### Data: the Ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "Data serves as the foundation of machine learning, providing the information needed to train algorithms. By inputting historical data and desired outcomes, machines learn to recognize patterns, make generalizations, and predict future events. Just like how students learn from many examples in textbooks, machines learn from lots of data. The abundance and diversity of data are crucial components, acting as the essential material for training machines to effectively solve various problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms: the Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms function as the blueprints guiding machine learning process. They outline the structured sequence of actions machines take to handle data, uncover complex patterns, and enhance their models. Just as teaching aims to offer guidance, algorithms empower machines to improve their own performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Machine Learning Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Any machine learning model consists of two main phases, that is **training** and **testing**. These phases are at the core of how machine learning models learn from data and then make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Training Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **training phase**, the machine learning model **learns from a dataset to build its knowledge or understanding** of a particular problem or task. Think of a teacher instructing a student by providing examples and guiding them through exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model seeks patterns, relationships, and insights within the data so that it can later apply this knowledge to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Testing Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **testing phase**, the machine learning **model's knowledge is put to the test**. It's like giving the student a new set of problems or challenges to solve independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model applies what it has learned during training to make predictions on new, unseen data and is evaluated based on its accuracy.\n",

    "## 🌐 Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Mitchell, in his widely recognized definition, explained that \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` if its performance at tasks in `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Across various fields, machine learning has proven its worth. In robotics, it equips machines to autonomously navigate complex environments and avoid collision with obstacles. The healthcare sector benefits from its diagnostic power, aiding in the early detection of diseases and personalized treatment plans. In finance, it's a behind-the-scenes analyst, crunching numbers and predicting market trends with high accuracy. In the field of entertainment, machine learning breathes life into recommendation systems, ensuring you find movies, music, and content tailored to your tastes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discover how we can put the idea of machine learning into action in different situations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Robot Navigation: Guiding Autonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Task (T)`: Teach a robot to navigate through a complex environment and avoid obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Experience (E)`: Present the robot with various environments, showing successful navigation paths and failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Performance (P)`: Measure the robot's success in reaching its destination without collisions or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Computer Vision: Recognizing Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Task (T)`: Enable a computer to identify and classify objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Experience (E)`: Show the computer a large dataset of images with labeled objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Performance (P)`: Evaluate the accuracy of the computer's object recognition by comparing its classifications with the ground truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. House Price Prediction: Real Estate Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Task (T)`: Develop a model that predicts house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Experience (E)`: Train the model with historical data on house attributes and their corresponding prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Performance (P)`: Assess the model's accuracy in predicting house prices by comparing its estimates with actual sale prices\n",

    "Ready to experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to experiment with machine learning is to use [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, and poses. The goal is to create a custom machine learning model that can classify objects or actions based on input from your device's camera or microphone. This involves training the model by providing examples of the objects or actions you want it to recognize. \n",
    "\n",
    "The  main steps to achieve this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gathering and labeling data**: Collect a set of images or audio recordings representing the different classes or categories you want your model to identify. Label each example to indicate which class it belongs to. Gather for example several objects at your surroundings, such as books, mugs, or vairous types of fruits. Use the camera to record multiple screenshots of these objects, all at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training the model**: Upload your labeled data to Teachable Machine and use it to train your custom model. The platform will automatically generate a machine learning model based on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and using the model**: Once your model is trained, you can test it in real-time using your device's camera or microphone. It will classify objects or actions based on what it has learned from your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, you can experiment with machine learning using Teachable Machine to create models tailored to your specific needs and applications."
